### Year 2022/23 Semester 1 CZ4003 Computer Vision Lab Experiment 1
<br>
<br>
<b>Objectives</b>
This laboratory aims to introduce image processing in MATLAB context. In this laboratory you will:<br><br>
a. Become familiar with the MATLAB and Image Processing Toolbox software package.<br>
b. Experiment with the point processing operations of contrast stretching and histogram
equalization.<br><br>
c. Evaluate how different Gaussian and median filters are suitable for noise removal.<br>
d. Become familiar with the frequency domain operations<br>
e. Understand imaging geometry<br>
<br>
<br>
